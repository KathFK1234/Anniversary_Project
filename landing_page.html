  <p>Hey Princessa. <br> <br>
      Here's a not-so-little surprise I tried making for us today. 🤭🤭 <br> <br>
      This will be a walk down memory lane of our journey thus far <br> <br>
      (with a few (okay, wongo) snapshots of you, because you're definitely the most beautiful woman ever) <br> <br>
      in celebration of the people we have grown to be, with and for one another. 🩵🩵<br> <br>
      Sit back, relax, and perhaps get a tissue in advance <3 and enjoy.

      <br> <br>
      I hope it makes your day as bright as you are to me ❤️
  </p>

  <br>

  <div>
    <p>
      We start with an admiration beginning, because you're absolutely the most beautiful woman I have the honour to love and be loved by.

        This was in celebration of a day I tend to sleep away (and that I cried away) 🩵 <br> <br>
        but not that that would have stopped you from making sure you did your best to appreciate me either way <br> <br>
        and I am eternally grateful for that, a lot more than I express, in a futile attempt to be or seem "composed" 🫠

      <h3>My Letter to You Today</h3>
      <p>
        Hi you again :) <br> <br>
        Yeah, that might have been a bit plenty to put and call a not-so-little project, but YK, it's you, and you're worth the effort. <br> <br>
        Growing with and in love with you for the past one year has been one of the most valuable and honourable moments of my life. <br> <br>
        We have loved, we have fought, we have been upset, we have been happy, we have been lost, and still, we found our way back to each other. <br> <br>
        The one thing that stands the test of time for sure is that I am definitely intentional on choosing you every single time. <br> <br>
        I choose you when I am happy, and when I'm sad. When we're happy and when we're sad. When things are okay, and when they're not. <br> <br>
        When things are easy, and when they're hard. When we're upset, and when we're floating in euphoria. I choose you, and I am more than <br> <br>
        honoured to get to choose you every single time. Not that I am forced to, but because I want to. Through it all, I want to and will <br> <br>
        choose you. It is not the easiest thing, journeying together and unlearning habits and traits that are almost part of our skin, <br> <br>
        but I wouldn't have or choose any other to navigate it all with. There will be hard days, perhaps even harder than the ones we've seen. <br> <br>
        There will be days when things will be complicated, when they will be difficult to navigate, but either way, I choose you. I want to choose you. <br> <br>
        Even when the down days are inevitable, so are the higher ones. Days when all I want to do is stare at you in awe, because that's all <br> <br>
        that I want to do in that given moment. Stare and take you in. Grow more and deeper in love with you. Grow as an individual for and <br> <br>
        because of you, for me and for you, and for us. Consciously and intentionally choosing to do so, because I can. And on this day, <br> <br>
        I celebrate the journey we have had. The journey we have had thus far, and the one we shall keep going on, for as long as <br> <br>
        the universe allows us to. In this and every other lifetime, I would always find my way to you, to choose you, because you're more <br> <br>
        than the best decision I have ever made in my life. And since I keep lacking sufficient words to express myself as deeply as I feel, <br> <br>
        I shall keep doing my best to show it, grandly and subtly, often and rarely, comfortably and uncomfortably. If it means I get to hold <br> <br>
        and be held by you, then I would make the choice to do so more times than I can count. All this to say, in different weaves of words, <br> <br>
        that I love you. I love you, beyond the capacity of comprehension of my mind, or emotional containerization of my heart. <br> <br>
        With abundant love on this day, <br> <br>
        K. <br>
